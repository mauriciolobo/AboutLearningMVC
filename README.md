# Learning MVC4
========

This is my learning project. Actually, it's helping me to remember some stuffs and I'll keep on Github to whenever I need it.

## UserContex

It was just a simple class to get the User Name, and others details beyond IPrincipal User.

## Ninject.MVC3

Just to see the behavior of Nuget Ninject.MVC3. Pretty easy, so far.

## Ninject Manually

It'll change the MVC Framework Controller Factory (ControllerBuilder) to use the a Ninject/Custom Controller Factory.
